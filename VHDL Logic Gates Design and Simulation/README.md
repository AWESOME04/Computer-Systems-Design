# VDHL Logic Gates

This repository contains VHDL code and simulation results for the design of NAND, NOR, and Exclusive NOR gates. These logic gates are implemented using the VHDL language and simulated using ModelSim.
The code is implemented using the concepts learned in the VHDL lab session. The simulation results are visualized using the WAVE feature provided by ModelSim

## Logic Gates Implemented

    NAND gate
    NOR gate
    Exclusive NOR gate

## Methodology

The methodology for implementing the logic gates includes the following steps:

    Designing the block diagram of the entity, showing the port terminals and their data types.
    Explaining the architecture(s) used for each logic gate.

## Results and Discussion

The results and discussion section includes:

    Truth tables for each logic gate.
    Waveform simulation of the design for all possible input combinations using the WAVE feature in ModelSim.
    A comparison of the truth tables with the simulation results and an explanation of any similarities or differences observed.
